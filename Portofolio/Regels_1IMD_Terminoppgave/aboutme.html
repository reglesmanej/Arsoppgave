        <h1 id="titel">About Me</h1>
        <hr>
        <p id="tekst">My name is Regels, I am a 17-year-old boy from Albania. I have two little siblings one of them is
            14 and the
            other one is 10. I lived in Albania most of my life but then I moved to Norway 3 years ago. Since I moved to
            Norway I have been to four different schools, and I have learned different things from each of them. I can
            speak three different languages, Albanian, English and Norwegian. The hardest language that I had to learn
            was Norwegian, but I still learned it because I never give up on something. When I am interested or curios
            about something, I always want to get to know more about it. That is one of the main reasons on why I joined
            IM. I knew what computers and internet were, because I grew up playing videogames, but I wanted to get
            deeper and get to know how to make a game or a website myself.


        <h2 id="titel">My hobbies </h2>
        <hr>
        <p id="tekst">
            Other than coding and programing I have a lot of hobbies. One of my favorites things to do in my free time
            is to play football. But my favorite hobby is gaming, I really like to compete and play games such as CS: GO
            and League of Legends. What is fun about these games is that u can speak with other players and get to know
            more about other people. Other than playing games I also like to hang out with my friends.

        <h3 id="titel">Dream job</h3>
        <hr>
        <p id="tekst">
            My dream was to become a footballer, but unfortunately I broke my leg a couple years back and was not able
            to play for 2 years. After that I stopped playing so much and I did not pursue my dream. However, I am
            pursuing programing and want to be a programmer. I want to be able to create apps and websites for people to
            enjoy. Everything that I am going to learn and have learnt so far, I want to pass it on to the younger
            generations for them to get to know more about the internet.
